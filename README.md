### 👋 Hi, I'm Jose

Software & Broadband Architect focused on control-plane systems,
IEEE 1905, EasyMesh, and RDK-B platforms.

25+ years designing and evolving large-scale telecom and networking
systems across vendors and operators.

---

### 🧭 Architectural Focus
- Broadband control-plane architecture (EasyMesh, IEEE 1905, SDN)
- Distributed topology discovery, convergence, and coordination
- Evaluation and introduction of new technologies for broadband platforms
  (Rust, Arm SystemReady, RISC-V)
- Radio technologies and their integration into broadband systems
  (5G, Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi HaLow)
- Linux-based embedded systems and networking stacks

---

### 🤝 Community & Open-Source Contributions
- RDK-B projects: CellularManager, EasyMesh, xPonManager, ApplicationFramework
- Other projects: Networking, synchronization, security, and platform frameworks
